    <b>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place 
        of English to emphasise design elements over content.It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. 
        It's a convenient tool for mock-ups.It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or 
        presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. layout</b>

        Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. 
        <i>Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its 
        content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore.</i> While lorem ipsum's
        still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't 
        contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to 
        mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

        <li>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication 
            to be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready</li>
          <br>
         <li>Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day of going live. However, 
            reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a 
            newspaper or the internet.</li>
    </ul>

        Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32â€“3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum 
        (On the Boundaries of Goods and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro 
        quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known 
        version ("Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain 
        it"). It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney 
        College in Virginia; he searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin literature, a term of 
        remarkably low frequency in that literary corpus.

        Cicero famously orated against his political opponent Lucius Sergius Catilina. Occasionally the first 
        Oration against Catiline is taken for type specimens: Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia 
        nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet? How long, O Catiline, will you abuse our patience?
         And for how long will that madness of yours mock us and location.
